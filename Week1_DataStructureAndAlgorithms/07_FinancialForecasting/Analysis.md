## Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm

The recursive algorithm for financial forecasting runs in **O(n)** time, as it performs one calculation for each time period. However, each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, increasing memory usage.

## Optimizing the Recursive Solution

To avoid excessive computation and memory issues we can use an **iterative approach**, which also runs in **O(n)** but uses constant memory.
