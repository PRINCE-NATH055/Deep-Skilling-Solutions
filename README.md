# Week 1 â€“ Deep Skilling Summary

This week covered core topics in two areas: **Design Patterns** and **Algorithms**. I completed four hands-on exercises focused on implementing design principles and analyzing algorithm performance.

## Completed Exercises

### Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern  
**Skill:** Design Principles and Patterns  
Created a `Logger` C# class that ensures only one instance exists during runtime.

**Learnings:**
- Singleton design pattern fundamentals
- Static instance control and private constructor

---

### Exercise 2: Factory Method Pattern  
**Skill:** Design Principles and Patterns  
Designed a document creation system using an abstract `DocumentFactory` and concrete factories for Word, PDF, and Excel documents.

**Learnings:**
- Use of abstract classes and interfaces
- Factory Method pattern for flexible object creation
- Benefits for scalability and maintainability

---

### Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting (Recursion)  
**Skill:** Data Structures and Algorithms  
Built a recursive function to predict future values based on past trends.

**Learnings:**
- Recursion basics and use cases
- Time complexity analysis

---

### Exercise 2: E-commerce Search Function  
**Skill:** Data Structures and Algorithms  
Implemented linear and binary search on a list of products.

**Learnings:**
- Big O notation and performance comparison
- Use cases for linear vs. binary search
- Importance of sorted data in search efficiency

## Summary

- Applied two major design patterns in C# practical scenarios.
- Practiced algorithm analysis and recursive thinking.
- Improved coding structure, abstraction, and documentation.
