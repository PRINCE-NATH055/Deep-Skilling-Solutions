Web API Hands-on Report

1. RESTful Web Service, Web API, & Microservice

- REST: Representational State Transfer (stateless, uses HTTP, resource-based URLs)
- Features: Stateless, message-based, not restricted to XML (JSON, etc.)
- Microservice: Small, independently deployable service units.
- WebService vs WebAPI: WebAPI is lighter, can return multiple formats, and integrates easily with HTTP verbs.

2. HttpRequest & HttpResponse

- HttpRequest: Incoming HTTP request data (method, headers, body).
- HttpResponse: Outgoing response sent back (status code, body, headers).

---

3. Action Verbs

- HttpGet: Get data.
- HttpPost: Create new data.
- HttpPut: Update existing data.
- HttpDelete: Delete data.
